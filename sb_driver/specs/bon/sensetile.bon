explanation
  "The SenseTile system enable scientists to run experiments on \
  \heterogeneus sensors networks. It can deploy applications on  \
  \sensors nodes and processor nodes, it can collect data coming from sensors \
  \it can run experiments on collected data."

cluster SENSOR_BOARD
description
  "The sensor board is a custom made hardware board dedicated to collect data \
  \from a set of heterogeneous sensors.\
  \The sensor board communicates with a processor unit via an usb channel, \
  \supporting a bidirectional serial data stream communication."

cluster PROCESSOR_UNIT
description
  "The processor unit is a small size complete pc dedicated to collect data \
  \from sensor board and other sensor sources, process data, and provide data \
  \stream to the server nodes."

cluster SERVER
description
  "The server node collect data coming from processor units, manage the data \ 
  \store, process data according to the various experiments the scientists \ 
  \ wants to run."

cluster DATA_STORE
description
  "The data store passively stores processed data."

cluster SCIENTIST
description
  "Scientists deploy experiments into server nodes, processor boards and \
  \sensor boards which store processed data into data store. \
  \Scientists run experiments on stored data."

cluster SECURITY
description
  "Security manage security requirements, as identity, authenitcation and \
  \authorization."
