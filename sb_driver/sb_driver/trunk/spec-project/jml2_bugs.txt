JML2 : indentation problem

error: Variable "absoluteIndex" may not have been initialized before use
int absoluteIndex = (
  index + 
    (getPacketLength() - ByteArrayPacket.PATTERN_OFFSET)
  ) % getPacketLength();

quick patch:
int absoluteIndex = 0;
absoluteIndex = (
  index + 
    (getPacketLength() - ByteArrayPacket.PATTERN_OFFSET)
  ) % getPacketLength();



JML2 : inner classes

problems with scope
Interfaces recognized only if preceded with parent class
standard Java do not have this behaviour

not able to reproduce in a simpler case



JML2 : public constants

problems with scope
public constants are not recognized

not able to reproduce in a simpler case
