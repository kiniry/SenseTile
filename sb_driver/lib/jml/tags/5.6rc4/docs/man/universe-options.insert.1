"dynchecks"
.RS
code for UTS runtime checks (for downcasts and array updates)
is generated.

"purity"
.RS
purity of methods is checked with a conservative method, which
might forbid some methods that do not modify existing objects.
.RE
.PP
"xbytecode"
.RS
Universe type information is stored in special bytecode attributes.
.br
This also turns on the "check" option, because it is important that
the stored information is type-checked.
.br
The resulting class-file is compatible with standard Java VMs.
.RE
.PP
"annotations"
.RS
Universe type information is stored in Java 5 annotations.
.br
This also turns on the "check" option, because it is important that
the stored information is type-checked.
.br
The resulting class-file is compatible with Java 5 VMs.
.RE
.PP

all UTS features except "annotations" are enabled;
this corresponds to the \-\-universes flag below.
.RE
.RE
