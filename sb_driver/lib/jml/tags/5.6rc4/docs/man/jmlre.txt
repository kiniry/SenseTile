NAME
       jmlre  -	 run Java programs compiled with the JML executable specifica-
       tion compiler

SYNOPSIS
       jmlre [java-option] ... FQClassName

DESCRIPTION
       jmlre runs a Java(TM) program, named in the FQClassName argument,  that
       has been compiled using the JML executable specification compiler jmle.
       It provides the program access to classes in  the  org.jmlspecs.jmlexec
       package	by adding to the end of the CLASSPATH environment variable the
       file JML/bin/jml-release.jar.

OPTIONS
       This script simply passes along all  its	 arguments  to	java  ,	 which
       should be consulted for details of its options.

EXAMPLES
       Suppose	that  the file ‘Test.jml’ has been compiled using jmle(1), and
       that the file ’TestTest.java’ (which has a  main	 method	 that  creates
       instances  of  class  Test  and	uses them to call methods specified in
       class Test) has been compiled using javac(1).  Then  one	 can  run  the
       TestTest class as follows.
	      jmlre TestTest

       If  class TestTest is located in some package, then the fully qualified
       package name should be specified in the command line to jmlre .

ENVIRONMENT
       During the execution of the program, the CLASSPATH environment variable
       is  changed  by placing the JML release jar file (‘jml-release.jar’) at
       the end of the CLASSPATH during the run.

       In the Unix version of this script, the location of the	JML  installa-
       tion’s  top directory is taken from the JMLDIR environment variable, if
       that is defined.
