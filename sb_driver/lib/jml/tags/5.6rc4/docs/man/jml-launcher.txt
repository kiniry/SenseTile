[1mNAME[0m
       jml-launcher - Java Modeling Language (JML) tool launcher

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mjml-launcher[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  command  [1mjml-launcher  [22mstarts  a graphical user interface that can
       launch other JML tools.  These include the JML checker (jml), the  run-
       time  assertion  checking  compiler (jmlc), the documentation generator
       (jmldoc), the specification skeleton generator (jmlspec), and the  unit
       testing file generation tool (jmlunit).

       The  launcher  can  also  be  run by opening (double clicking) the file
       bin/jml-release.jar that is part of the JML release.  The jar file  and
       the script both run the Java class org.jmlspecs.launcher.JmlLauncher.

       The  user needs to be careful to set the [1mCLASSPATH [22min the text box pro-
       vided by the various tools.  When the launcher starts it may not have a
       proper [1mCLASSPATH [22mset.

[1mWHAT TO READ[0m
       If  you  are  new  to JML, you'll want to look at some of the documents
       that ship with the system.  You can access it from a web browser easily
       starting  at the JML.html file in the top-level JML directory, $JMLDIR,
       i.e., from
              $JMLDIR/JML.html
       See also the the JML web page.
