[1mNAME[0m
       jml-junit  -  run  JUnit  tests  that  were compiled with JML's runtime
       assertion checking compiler

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mjml-junit [22mTestDataClassName

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mjml-junit [22mruns JUnit tests of a Java(TM) program, named in the [1mTestDat-[0m
       [1maClassName  [22margument,  that  has  been  compiled  using the JML runtime
       assertion checker compiler [1mjmlc[22m.  It provides  the  program  access  to
       classes  in  the org.jmlspecs.jmlunit org.jmlspecs.models, and org.jml-
       specs.jmlrac.runtime packages.  It  also  provides  access  to  runtime
       assertion  checked  version of interfaces in the J2SDK libraries (e.g.,
       in java.lang and java.util).  Access to classes in org.jmlspecs.jmlunit
       and org.jmlspecs.models are provided by adding to the end of the CLASS-
       PATH environment variable  the  files  JML/bin/jmljunitruntime.jar  and
       JML/bin/jmlmodels.jar.   Access  to  the other classes is done by using
       the Xbootclasspath option of the [1mjava [22mprogram, and using that option to
       add  JML/bin/jmlruntime.jar  to  the boot class path.  With this option
       set, it runs the [1mjava [22mprogram on JUnit's swing  graphical  user  inter-
       face, junit.swingui.TestRunner, passing along the rest of the aguments.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1m--nocheckmodels[0m
              When this option is present, the JML models used  are  those  in
              the jar file JML/bin/jmlmodelsnonrac.jar, which does not do run-
              time assertion checking in the org.jmlspecs.models and  org.jml-
              specs.models.resolve packages.  The default is to use the models
              in JML/bin/jmlmodels.jar, which does  do  runtime  assertion  of
              these types.

       Aside  from the --nocheckmodels option, this script simply passes along
       all its arguments to JUnit's junit.swingui.TestRunner, which should  be
       consulted for details of its options.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       The  [1mCLASSPATH [22menvironment variable is changed by placing the JUnit jar
       file    (`junit.jar'),     the     JML/bin/jmljunitruntime.jar,     and
       JML/bin/jmlmodels.jar files at the end of the CLASSPATH during the run.
       The JML/bin/jmlruntime.jar file is added to the bootclass path.

       In the Unix version of this script, the location of the  JML  installa-
       tion's  top directory is taken from the JMLDIR environment variable, if
       that is defined.  Similarly, the location of JUnit's top  directory  is
       taken from the JUNITDIR environment variable, if that is defined.
