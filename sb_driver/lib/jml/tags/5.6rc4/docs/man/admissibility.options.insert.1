.B \-\-admissibility <String>
Checks the admissibility of invariants and represents clauses
in accordance with a certain proof technique. For more details
about admissibility see "Modular Invariants for Layered Object Structures" by 
P. Mueller, A. Poetzsch-Heffter and G. Leavens, 2004.
.br
Statics (static invariants, static represents clauses and static
fields appearing in one of the former) and method calls (in an invariant
or a represents clause) are not yet supported.

Available option strings:

"none"
.RS
No admissibility checks are performed.
.br
This is the default.
.RE

"classical"
.RS
Admissibility checks of invariants and represents clauses
are done in accordance with the
classical modular proof technique.
.br
See the above
mentioned paper for details.
.RE
.PP
"ownership"
.RS
Admissibility checks of invariants and represents clauses
are done in accordance with the
ownership proof technique, using the UTS information.
Therefore this option only makes sense if the UTS
is enabled at least for parsing and typechecking.
Additionally fields and methods are checked to ensure subclass
separation.
