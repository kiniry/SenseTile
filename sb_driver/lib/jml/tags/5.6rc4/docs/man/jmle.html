<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>

<p><b>jmle</b> [option] ... file-or-directory-or-package
[file-or-directory-or-package] ...<br>
The command <b>jmle</b> compiles JML class specifications
contained in Java and JML specification files into
executable prototypes of the specified classes. Any Java(TM)
code in method bodies is ignored - only the specifications
of methods are compiled. The output is .class file(s), which
can be treated in much the same way as the output of any
java compiler. Note, however, that the .class files produced
by <b>jmle</b> depend on classes in the org.jmlspecs.jmlexec
package, which therefore also need to be loaded. These can
be obtained from the file JML/bin/jml-release.jar in the JML
release. The JML release provides the script <b>jmlre</b>
which adds this jar file to the CLASSPATH and then runs
java, which facilitates this loading process. As the JML
specifications are translated to constraint programs, the
resulting executables are significantly slower and use much
more memory than would be typical of hand-coded
implementations of the same specifications.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>The class files produced by <b>jmle</b> can be mixed with
those generated by other Java compilers. However, the
specifications of all superclasses and implemented
interfaces (except for standard Java(TM) and JML library
classes and interfaces) must be compiled by <b>jmle ,</b>
either prior to compiling the class specification of
interest or all together (on the same command line).
Similarly, if a specification uses instances of classes
other than standard Java(TM) or JML library classes, the
specifications of those classes must also be compiled with
<b>jmle .</b> For refinement chains, only the file in the
chain containing the specification that you wish to execute
should be compiled using <b>jmle .</b> Usually, this would
be the last file in the chain, but it need not be if you do
not wish to execute all specifications in the refinement
chain.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>The <b>jmle</b> script sets the CLASSPATH and then runs
the Java class org.jmlspecs.jmlexec.Main, which does both
syntax and type checking of Java and JML files, and then
generates the JVM bytecode in class files for each of the
Java files (i.e., for each .java or .jml file).</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>If the compiler finds an error, the file name, line
number, and column number where the error occurred are
reported. In such cases, by default, processing stops and no
output will be produced for the files.</p>

<b>jmle</b>, see the EXAMPLES section below.</p>

<p>The <b>jmle</b> script supports the options described
below. Both options without arguments and options with
arguments simply set the option as indicated by the
description below. Multiple uses of the same option
generally have no effect that is different than a single use
of that option.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>For the command line, each option has both a short form
and two long forms. The long forms consists of one or two
hyphens and a word. To avoid duplication, we only show the
long forms with two hyphens, since these are unambiguous;
however one can use the forms with a single hyphen if
desired. To avoid ambiguity between multiple short form
options and the long form with a single hyphen, one should
give each option separately. The short form consists of a
hyphen and a single letter. In the synopsis below, the long
form is separated from the short form by a comma (,), but in
actual usage, you would pick one of these forms and not use
the comma.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Note that options on the command line are case
sensitive.</p>

<p>Produces (copious) debugging information. The default is
not to produce this information. Additionally, when the
executable generated from the specification is run, a
complete trace of all constraint handling rules used in
executing the specification is printed. The entire
constraint store and the bindings of all logic variables are
printed each time a constraint is considered for
simplification, so the trace can become quite large.</p>

<p>This produces Test.class, which can be treated as
ordinary JVM bytecode. That is, you can write, compile and
run ordinary Java code that creates instances of class Test
and uses those instances to call the methods of class
Test.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>To run programs compiled with <b>jmle</b> you need to
have various runtime classes in your CLASSPATH. The jmlre(1)
script provides a way to do this automatically. See its
manual page for more details.</p>

<p>The <b>jmle</b> script sets the CLASSPATH environment
variable, but does not look at any -classpath option that
might be used. If you use a -classpath option, then you must
explicitly include paths to the jar files and directories
that this script would have otherwise included. On the other
hand, this allows you to override the default orderings for
such jar files and directories.</p>
