<p>
This package contains samples of JML specifications
that are related to lists of various flavors.  This package was
written by and is maintained by Clyde Ruby.

The purpose of these examples is to test some of the techniques developed in 
Clyde Ruby's dissertation research.  Thus the programs are sometimes more 
complex than necessary.  That is, the programs are not always 
typical or "ideal" ways to implement these classes, but rather serve to 
provide examples of how to deal with (when possible) some of the problems 
caused by aliasing and downcalls.
