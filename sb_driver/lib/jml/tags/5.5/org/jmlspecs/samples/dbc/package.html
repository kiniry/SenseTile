<title>Design by Contract (DBC) Samples</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">

<p>
This package contains samples of JML specifications
written in the style of design by contract.
The ideas to demonstrate how JML can be used as a design by contract language.
That is, of the specifications do not use JML's heavyweight
specification cases, they did not use assignable clauses, and they
mostly did not use model features.  (There are however, a few model
methods.)
</p>

<p>
The style of specification used in these examples leads to
underspecification for interfaces.  The solution would be to use model
fields, however we do not wish to do that in this set of examples.
