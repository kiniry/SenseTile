<title>Specifications for the paper: JML a Notation for Detailed Design</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">

<p>
This package contains samples of JML specifications from the
tutorials.  Currently this is a paper by 
Gary T. Leavens and Yoonsik Cheon titled 
 "Design by Contract with JML".
</p>

<p>
The examples appear here so that they can be checked with the JML
checker during testing of the release, and so we can be sure that they
conform to the language.
