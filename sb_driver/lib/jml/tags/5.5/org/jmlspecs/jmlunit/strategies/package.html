<p>
The types in this package are used in providing test data for
JML/JUnit testing.
These types constitute a small framework, and users should not
hesitate to extend them in ways that are useful for their purposes.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
In this package are mainly two kinds of types:
<a href="#Iterators">iterators</a> and
<a href="#Strategies">strategies</a>.
These follow the design patterns of the same names.
There are also some other miscellaneous types related to JML/JUnit testing.
</p>

<p>
Test data are provided to the test drivers through iterators.  In this
package, strategies are mainly used as ways to compute iterators for
providing test data.  We now describe iterators and strategies in more detail.
We began by describing the iterators, because the strategies build on them.
However, readers may want to skip directly to the
<a href="#Strategies">discussion of strategies</a>,
because the strategies are most often used by testers,
whereas the iterators are usually only used indirectly.
</p>

<h3><a name="Iterators">Iterators</a></h3>
<p>
The iterators describe the mechanisms for iterating over data of a
given type.  The fundamental interface for these iterators is the type
<kbd><a href="IndefiniteIterator.html">IndefiniteIterator</a></kbd>.
An indefinite iterator can be thought of as a cursor that points into a
sequence. Unlike normal Java iterators (such as
{@link java.util.Iterator}), an indefinite iterator does not
advance when the <kbd>get()</kbd> method is called; instead, the
<kbd>advance()</kbd> method must be called explicitly to advance the
cursor.  This is useful for the loops in the test drivers, which must
provide data for an outer loop's type for each iteration of an inner loop.
</p>

<p>
They are two kinds of iterators that implement or extend this
interface.  The first is a set of iterators that can iterate over objects
(i.e., references to objects).  The second is a set of iterators that
can iterate over primitive values (such as booleans or ints).
</p>

<h4>Iterators That Iterate Over Objects</h4>

<p>
The concrete class
<kbd><a href="ImmutableObjectArrayIterator.html">ImmutableObjectArrayIterator</a></kbd>
can be used in testing objects of types that have immutable objects
(such as {@link java.lang.String}).
Its <kbd>get()</kbd> method simply returns the current object
from the array of immutable objects passed to its constructor.
</p>

<p>
The abstract class
<kbd><a href="CloneableObjectArrayAbstractIterator.html">CloneableObjectArrayAbstractIterator</a></kbd>
can be used in testing objects of types that have a <kbd>clone()</kbd> method.
The <kbd>get()</kbd> method of this iteratoro returns a clone of the
current object from the array of immutable objects passed to its constructor.
Unfortunately, because Java doesn't have a standard interface with a 
public <kbd>clone()</kbd> method ({@link java.lang.Cloneable} should have
this, but doesn't), there is no way to make this class concrete.
Instead it relies on a <kbd>cloneElement(Object)</kbd> method to clone the
objects of the type.  
The <kbd>cloneElement(Object)</kbd> method is specified to be "pure", and so
it cannot call a <kbd>clone()</kbd> method that is not pure.  If that
is not possible, then one should use the following iterator type.
</p>

<p>
The abstract class
<kbd><a href="NewObjectAbstractIterator.html">NewObjectAbstractIterator</a></kbd>
describes a family of iterators that provide test data by creating
an object each time the <kbd>get()</kbd> method is called. 
Generally this would be done to avoid aliasing between the objects
used in testing. (However one can also use this kind of iterator to
create intentional aliasing if desired, by returning the same object
multiple times when the <kbd>get()</kbd> method is called.)
This package does not provide any useful concrete subclasses of
<kbd><a href="NewObjectAbstractIterator.html">NewObjectAbstractIterator</a></kbd>. 
However, there is an subclass that defines an empty new object
iterator in 
<kbd><a href="EmptyNewObjectIterator.html">EmptyNewObjectIterator</a></kbd>,
and an anonymous subclass in
<kbd><a href="NewObjectAbstractStrategy.html">NewObjectAbstractStrategy</a></kbd>.
</p>

<p>
The classes 
<kbd><a href="ImmutableObjectArrayIterator.html">ImmutableObjectArrayIterator</a></kbd>,
<kbd><a href="CloneableObjectArrayAbstractIterator.html">CloneableObjectArrayAbstractIterator</a></kbd>,
and
<kbd><a href="NewObjectAbstractIterator.html">NewObjectAbstractIterator</a></kbd>
correspond to three of the basic strategies
for producing test data, which are embodied in this package by the classes
<kbd><a href="ImmutableObjectAbstractStrategy.html">ImmutableObjectAbstractStrategy</a></kbd>,
<kbd><a href="CloneableObjectAbstractStrategy.html">CloneableObjectAbstractStrategy</a></kbd>,
and
<kbd><a href="NewObjectAbstractStrategy.html">NewObjectAbstractStrategy</a></kbd>,
respectively.
There also some classes that are convenient for constructing other
indefinite iterators that return objects.  These are described below.
</p>

<p>
The concrete class
<kbd><a href="CompositeIterator.html">CompositeIterator</a></kbd>
allows one to compose several indefinite iterators into one larger
indefinite iteration.
</p>

<p>
The concrete class
<kbd><a href="NonNullIteratorDecorator.html">NonNullIteratorDecorator</a></kbd>
allows one to filter out <kbd>null</kbd>
values from an indefinite iteration.
It is built as a subclass of
<kbd><a href="AbstractFilteringIteratorDecorator.html">AbstractFilteringIteratorDecorator</a></kbd>
from which you may build other filtering iterator decorators.
</p>

<h4>Iterators That  Iterate Over Primitive Values</h4>

<p>
To provide efficient access to indefinite iteration elements of
primitive value types, this package also provides several other implementations
of the
<kbd><a href="IndefiniteIterator.html">IndefiniteIterator</a></kbd>
interface.
Indeed, this interface
is extended by an interface for each primitive value type
in Java: namely
<kbd><a href="BooleanIterator.html">BooleanIterator</a></kbd>,
<kbd><a href="ByteIterator.html">ByteIterator</a></kbd>,
<kbd><a href="CharIterator.html">CharIterator</a></kbd>,
<kbd><a href="DoubleIterator.html">DoubleIterator</a></kbd>,
<kbd><a href="FloatIterator.html">FloatIterator</a></kbd>,
<kbd><a href="IntIterator.html">IntIterator</a></kbd>,
<kbd><a href="LongIterator.html">LongIterator</a></kbd>, and
<kbd><a href="ShortIterator.html">ShortIterator</a></kbd>.
These extended interfaces iterate over values of the corresponding
primitive value types.  For example, <kbd>ShortIterator</kbd>
can iterate over the primitive type <kbd>short</kbd>.
For each such primitive value type <i>VT</i>, the corresponding interface 
<i>VT</i><kbd>Iterator</kbd> has a method,
<kbd>get</kbd><i>VT</i><kbd>()</kbd>,
that returns a value of the type <i>VT</i>.
For example,
<kbd><a href="ShortIterator.html">ShortIterator</a></kbd>
has a method <kbd>getShort()</kbd> that returns a value of type
<kbd>short</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
For each of the primitive value types,
<i>VT</i>, the corresponding interface 
is implemented by an abstract class, named, 
<i>VT</i><kbd>AbstractIterator</kbd>.
These abstract classes simply define the <kbd>get()</kbd>
method required by the interface using the 
<kbd>get</kbd><i>VT</i><kbd>()</kbd> method.
For example, 
the <kbd>get()</kbd>
method required by the interface 
<kbd><a href="ShortIterator.html">ShortIterator</a></kbd>
(inherited from <kbd><a href="IndefiniteIterator.html">IndefiniteIterator</a></kbd>)
is defined to call the
<kbd>getShort()</kbd> method, and to make the result the "boxed"
version
of that number, by calling the constructor for the boxed type <kbd>Short</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
Each such abstract class,
<i>VT</i><kbd>AbstractIterator</kbd>,
is in turn extended by a concrete class named
<i>VT</i><kbd>ArrayIterator</kbd>,
which can iterate over arrays of the type <i>VT</i>.
For example, 
<kbd><a href="ShortAbstractIterator.html">ShortAbstractIterator</a></kbd>
has a subclass
<kbd><a href="ShortArrayIterator.html">ShortArrayIterator</a></kbd>, 
which can iterator over arrays of type <kbd>short</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
Also, for each such value type,
<i>VT</i>, there is a composite iterator,
<i>VT</i><kbd>CompositeIterator</kbd>.
For example
<kbd><a href="ShortCompositeIterator.html">ShortCompositeIterator</a></kbd>
is one such class.
There is also an abstract filtering iterator decorator
<i>VT</i><kbd>AbstractFilteringIteratorDecorator</kbd> --
for example
<kbd><a href="ShortAbstractFilteringIteratorDecorator.html">ShortAbstractFilteringIteratorDecorator</a></kbd>.
These can be used to make your own filtering decorators.
An example, which also exists for each of the numeric types, is
<kbd><a href="ShortNonNegativeIteratorDecorator.html">ShortNonNegativeIteratorDecorator</a></kbd>.
</p>

<h3><a name="Strategies">Strategies</a></h3>

<p>
A strategy describes a way to compute an iterator.  Think of
strategies as embodying decisions about how to provide test data.
The fundamental interface for strategies is the type
<kbd><a href="StrategyType.html">StrategyType</a></kbd>.
This interface consists of a single method <kbd>iterator()</kbd>,
which can be called to return an 
<kbd><a href="IndefiniteIterator.html">IndefiniteIterator</a></kbd>
object.
This indefinite iterator provides the actual test data.
Thus the strategy's sole responsibility is to compute this iterator.
One way to do this is to provide the actual data (e.g., in an array)
to the constructor of an appropriate indefinite iterator class.
</p>

<p>
In what follows we first describe how one should pick a strategy, and
then describe the strategies in detail.

<h4>Choosing a Strategy</h4>

<p>
From the user's perspective, the choice of a strategy depends on the
kind of test data to be provided.
</p>

<h4>Strategies for Immutable Objects or Primitive Values</h4>

<p>
For types with immutable objects that are built-in to Java,
one can use a strategy that is provided in this package.
For example, for the type <kbd>String</kbd>
one would use the strategy
<kbd><a href="StringStrategy.html">StringStrategy</a></kbd>.
For a primitive value type, such as <kbd>short</kbd>
one would use the corresponding strategy,
such as <kbd><a href="ShortStrategy.html">ShortStrategy</a></kbd>.
For both kinds of strategies, the strategy itself provides only a very
small set of test data.  You can either use the slightly more extensive test
data provided in a class like
<kbd><a href="ShortBigStrategy.html">ShortBigStrategy</a></kbd>
or you can extend one of these strategies yourself
by defining a subclass that overrides the
<kbd>addData()</kbd> method
to provide the additional test data.
The <kbd>addData()</kbd> method returns an array of objects, and by
using an anonymous subclass and an array allocation expression,
in the body of the method override it is easy to provide test data
of such types.
For example, the following shows how to make a subclass of 
<kbd><a href="StringStrategy.html">StringStrategy</a></kbd>
that provides three additional pieces of test data.
Note that this is an expression in Java of type
<kbd><a href="StringStrategy.html">StringStrategy</a></kbd>.
<pre>
            new StringStrategy() {
                protected Object[] addData() {
                    return new String[] {
                        "Baby",
                        "Cortez",
                        "Yoonsik",
                    };
                }
            }
</pre>
</p>

<p>
For types with immutable objects
for which no strategy is provided in this package,
the user can subclass the framework's abstract class
<kbd><a href="ImmutableObjectAbstractStrategy.html">ImmutableObjectAbstractStrategy</a></kbd>.
By default this strategy provides only the <kbd>null</kbd> object. 
</p>

<p>
This abstract strategy is extended to by overriding the <kbd>addData()</kbd>
method, as shown above.
Examples of how to extend this strategy with your own data are found
in the class
<kbd><a href="ImmutableObjectAbstractStrategyTest.html">ImmutableObjectAbstractStrategyTest</a></kbd>.
</p>

<h4>Strategies for Cloneable Types</h4>
<p>
For types with mutable objects that have a <kbd>clone()</kbd> method,
one can make a subclass of the class
<kbd><a href="CloneableObjectAbstractStrategy.html">CloneableObjectAbstractStrategy</a></kbd>,
and provide test data by overriding
the <kbd>addData()</kbd> method, as above.
This strategy clones each object in the array of objects
provided as it is returned by the
<kbd>get()</kbd> method.  By default this strategy provides only
the <kbd>null</kbd> object.
</p>

<p>
This abstract strategy is extended to by overriding the <kbd>addData()</kbd>
method, in the same was as the
<kbd><a href="StringStrategy.html">StringStrategy</a></kbd> example
above.
However, subclasses of
<kbd><a href="CloneableObjectAbstractStrategy.html">CloneableObjectAbstractStrategy</a></kbd>
must also provide a <kbd>cloneElement(Object)</kbd> method.
</p>

<p>
Examples of how to extend this abstract strategy with your own data are found
in the class
<kbd><a href="CloneableObjectAbstractStrategyTest.html">CloneableObjectAbstractStrategyTest</a></kbd>.
</p>

<h4>Strategies for Non-Cloneable Types with Mutable Objects</h4>
<p>
For the case of a type with objects that are both mutable and not
cloneable,
one can make a subclass of
<kbd><a href="NewObjectAbstractStrategy.html">NewObjectAbstractStrategy</a></kbd>.
One has to override the <kbd>make(int)</kbd> method to provide test data.
This can also be done using an anonymous subclass.
For example, one can write the following expression to make such a
subclass and override the <kbd>make(int)</kbd> method.
<pre>
            new NewObjectAbstractStrategy() {
                public Object make(int n) {
                    switch (n) {
                    case 0:
                        return new Person("Baby");
                    case 1:
                        return new Person("Cortez");
                    case 2:
                        return new Person("Isabella");
                    default:
                        break;
                    }
                    throw new java.util.NoSuchElementException();
                }
            }
</pre>
Note that 
<kbd><a href="NewObjectAbstractStrategy.html">NewObjectAbstractStrategy</a></kbd> 
automatically adds <kbd>null</kbd> as a default piece of test data,
even though it is not returned the <kbd>make(int)</kbd> method.
In essence, the indefinite iterator returned by this strategy
is the composite of an iterator just returns <kbd>null</kbd> and one that
iterates over the test data provided by the override of the
<kbd>make(int)</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
There are also a few pre-defined strategies with the same extension
mechanism in this framework.  These are described below.
</p>

<p>
If the type you want to provide test data for is actually
{@link java.lang.Object},
then you can extend the type
<kbd><a href="ObjectStrategy.html">ObjectStrategy</a></kbd>,
in the same way as described above.
This strategy, by default, provides the <kbd>null</kbd> object
and an empty object, made with <kbd>new Object()</kbd>.
When you extend it with appropriate data by overriding
the <kbd>make(int)</kbd>, it can be useful for testing
an <kbd>equals</kbd> method.
</p>

<p>
An alternative to extending
<kbd><a href="ObjectStrategy.html">ObjectStrategy</a></kbd>
directly is to make a <a href="CompositeStrategy.html">composite</a>
of this strategy and a strategy for some other type (e.g., the type
whose objects you are actually testing).
This is especially useful for testing the <kbd>equals(Object)</kbd>
method, since it will provide some test data for which the <kbd>equals</kbd>
method will return <kbd>true</kbd>.
For example, if <kbd>vMyTypeStrategy</kbd> is a fields that holds a
strategy for providing test data of type <kbd>MyType</kbd>, the
the following would be an expression that computes a strategy
that is a composite of <kbd>ObjectStrategy</kbd> and
<kbd>vMyTypeStrategy</kbd>.
<pre>
        new org.jmlspecs.jmlunit.strategies.CompositeStrategy
        (new org.jmlspecs.jmlunit.strategies.StrategyType[] {
            new org.jmlspecs.jmlunit.strategies.ObjectStrategy(),
            vMyTypeStrategy,
         }
        )
</pre>
Note that <kbd>vMyTypeStrategy</kbd> has to already have a value for
this exprssion to be well-defined; hence <kbd>vMyTypeStrategy</kbd>
should have a definition that appears earlier than this expression in
the program.
</p>

<p>
In the same ways, you can extend the type
<kbd><a href="CollectionStrategy.html">CollectionStrategy</a></kbd>
to provide test data of type {@link java.util.Collection}.
By default, this strategy only provides a small amount of test data.
<kbd><a href="CollectionStrategy.html">CollectionStrategy</a></kbd>
is a good example of how to extend 
<kbd><a href="NewObjectAbstractStrategy.html">NewObjectAbstractStrategy</a></kbd>
to provide useful test data of some type.
(See also
<kbd><a href="NewObjectAbstractStrategyTest.html">NewObjectAbstractStrategyTest</a></kbd> 
for a small example.)
</p>

<h4>Combining and Filtering Strategies</h4>

<p>
You may sometimes find it convenient to combine strategies, or to
filter them.  The basic way to combine strategies is to use the
<kbd><a href="CompositeStrategy.html">CompositeStrategy</a></kbd>
type.  This class lets you combine two or more strategies by
sequencing the test data they provide.
Such composites also exist for each primitive value type;
for example, you can use 
<kbd><a href="ShortCompositeStrategy.html">ShortCompositeStrategy</a></kbd>
to combine strategies that provide test data of type <kbd>short</kbd>, etc.
</p>

<p>
The strategy
<kbd><a href="NonNullStrategyDecorator.html">NonNullStrategyDecorator</a></kbd>
is a Decorator that takes a strategy and filters it for non-null
elements; that is, it only passes along the elements that are not
null, effectively removing those that are null.  As a decorator, it
takes a strategy as an argument to its constructor.  This strategy is
built from the abstract class
<kbd><a href="AbstractFilteringStrategyDecorator.html">AbstractFilteringStrategyDecorator</a></kbd>,
which you can use to build your own filtering strategy decorators.
Such filtering strategies also exist for each primitive value type;
for example, you can use
<kbd><a href="ShortAbstractFilteringStrategyDecorator.html">ShortAbstractFilteringStrategyDecorator</a></kbd>
to define your own filtering decorators on strategies that provide data of type
<kbd>short</kbd>.
An example of this is found in
<kbd><a href="ShortNonNegativeStrategyDecorator.html">ShortNonNegativeStrategyDecorator</a></kbd>.
</p>

<h4>Details</h4>

<p>
They are two kinds of strategies that implement or extend the
<kbd><a href="StrategyType.html">StrategyType</a></kbd>
interface.  The first is a set of strategies that can be used 
to provide test data of reference types (subtypes of
<kbd>Object</kbd>).
The second is a set of strategies that can be used to provide test
data of primitive value types
(such as booleans or ints).
</p>

<h5>Strategies for Objects</h5>

<p>
The abstract class
<kbd><a href="ImmutableObjectAbstractStrategy.html">ImmutableObjectAbstractStrategy</a></kbd>
is a strategy for producing test data of types with immutable objects, like
<kbd>String</kbd>.
The strategy
<kbd><a href="JMLCollectionStrategy.html">JMLCollectionStrategy</a></kbd>
is built from this class.
</p>

<p>
The abstract class
<kbd><a href="CloneableObjectAbstractStrategy.html">CloneableAbstractStrategy</a></kbd>
is a strategy for producing test data for types with mutable objects
that have a <kbd>clone()</kbd> method.
The strategy
<kbd><a href="JMLTypeStrategy.html">JMLTypeStrategy</a></kbd>
is built from this class.
</p>

<p>
The abstract class
<kbd><a href="NewObjectAbstractStrategy.html">NewObjectAbstractStrategy</a></kbd>
is a strategy for producing test data for types with mutable objects
that do not have a <kbd>clone()</kbd> method.
</p>

<h5>Strategies for Primitive Values</h5>

<p>
For each of the primitive value types,
<i>VT</i>, there are two corresponding strategies:
<i>VT</i><kbd>Strategy</kbd> and 
<i>VT</i><kbd>BigStrategy</kbd>.
For example, for the primitive value type <kbd>short</kbd>
there are the strategies
<kbd><a href="ShortStrategy.html">ShortStrategy</a></kbd>
and
<kbd><a href="ShortBigStrategy.html">ShortStrategy</a></kbd>.
The classes with names of the form
<i>VT</i><kbd>Strategy</kbd> provide the barest minimum of test data.
For the integral types this consists of just the numbers 0, 1, and -1.
The floating point types provide these along with the "not a number"
value of the type.
The classes with names of the form
<i>VT</i><kbd>BigStrategy</kbd> provide a slightly larger amount
of test data; for the numeric types this includes the numbers 3, -5,
and the minimum and maximum values of each type.
For the floating point types, the <i>VT</i><kbd>BigStrategy</kbd>
classes also include the various infinities and smallest values.
</p>

<h5>Making Extensible Strategies Yourself</h5>

<p>
You may sometimes find it convenient to make a strategy extensible
yourself, in order to allow further specialization.
For immutable and cloneable objects,
you can do this in the same way as many of the standard strategies by
using the
<kbd><a href="ImmutableObjectExtensibleStrategyDecorator.html">ImmutableObjectExtensibleStrategyDecorator</a></kbd>
or the
<kbd><a href="CloneableObjectAbstractExtensibleStrategyDecorator.html">CloneableObjectAbstractExtensibleStrategyDecorator</a></kbd>.
These decorators are built from
<kbd><a href="AbstractExtensibleStrategyDecorator.html">AbstractExtensibleStrategyDecorator</a></kbd>,
which may be useful for more general cases.
Versions of such extensible strategy decorators
also exist for all the primitive value types;
for example, there is
<kbd><a href="ShortExtensibleStrategyDecorator.html">ShortExtensibleStrategyDecorator</a></kbd>.
</p>

<p>
For types with mutable objects that have no clone method,
you can subclass
<kbd><a href="NewObjectAbstractExtensibleStrategyDecorator.html">NewObjectAbstractExtensibleStrategyDecorator</a></kbd>.
For example, 
<kbd><a href="ObjectStrategy.html">ObjectStrategy</a></kbd> is built
as a subclass of this type.

<h2>Miscellaneous Types</h2>

<p>
The class
<kbd><a href="LimitedTestSuite.html">LimitedTestSuite</a></kbd>
is used in testing to "throttle" the tests.
It is a kind of test suite that accumulates test data up to a certain
point, and then becomes "full".
Its <kbd>addTest</kbd> method throws a 
<kbd><a href="TestSuiteFullException.html">TestSuiteFullException</a></kbd>
when a test is added to a full test suite.
</p>

<p>
The class
<kbd><a href="ConstructorFailed.html">ConstructorFailed</a></kbd>
is used to track errors that happen during test suite construction.
These typically result from a constructor that is implemented
incorrectly or doesn't satisfy its specification.  When called during
construction of the test suite, i.e., when the failure is part of
providing test data, then the problem is recorded as an instance of
this class.  Such a test, when run, simply reports the problem it stores.
</p>

<p>
The abstract class
<kbd><a href="IteratorAbstractAdapter.html">IteratorAbstractAdapter</a></kbd>
can be used to adapt an iterator to the indefinite iterator protocol.
This is an abstract class because iterators do not provide a <kbd>clone()</kbd>
method.
</p>

<p>
The class
<kbd><a href="IndefiniteIteratorUtilities.html">IndefiniteIteratorUtilities</a></kbd>
has various method that are used in various JUnit test classes in this
directory for testing the strategies.
The class <kbd><a href="CharStrategyTypeTest.html">CharStrategyTypeTest</a></kbd>
and the classes such as
<kbd><a href="ShortStrategyTypeTest.html">ShortStrategyTypeTest</a></kbd>
use these classes in their testing of the strategies.
</p>

<p>
The class
<kbd><a href="TracingTestSuite.html">TracingTestSuite</a></kbd>
is another subclass of {@link junit.framework.TestSuite}.
It is primarily intended for debugging.
</p>

<h2>Coding and the Makefiles</h2>

<p>
The main problem of coding in this package is how to avoid duplication
between value types, for example between
<kbd><a href="ShortIterator.html">ShortIterator</a></kbd> and
<kbd><a href="LongIterator.html">LongIterator</a></kbd>.
The way this is done is by coding these types once, and using a
<kbd>sed</kbd> script to make the different versions of a type.
For example, <kbd><a href="ShortIterator.html">ShortIterator</a></kbd> and
<kbd><a href="LongIterator.html">LongIterator</a></kbd>,
as well as several other types
are generated by the file <kbd>_ValueType_Iterator.java-generic</kbd> using the
script <kbd>_ValueType_.sh</kbd>.
Fragments of code that must be different in each type are defined
using one of the strings in the <kbd>sed</kbd> script.
Thus, it is important, when making changes to these types, to change
the corresponding <kbd>.java-generic</kbd> file, instead of the generated
<kbd>.java</kbd> files.  The <kbd>Makefile</kbd> is designed to make the
generated files read-only to prevent editing the wrong files.
</p>

<p>
With the <kbd>Makefile</kbd>, you can use <kbd>make generate</kbd> to generate
the files from the scripts.
See the targets in the makefile and the definition of the
<kbd>VALUETYPEGENERICS</kbd> macro for all of the generics.

<p>
Note, however that the types named, <kbd>...Strategy</kbd>
and <kbd>...BigStrategy</kbd>
are not generated from a single file, but rather handcrafted for each
type.  For example
<kbd><a href="ShortStrategy.html">ShortStrategy</a></kbd> and
<kbd><a href="LongStrategy.html">LongStrategy</a></kbd>,
are written in this way.
