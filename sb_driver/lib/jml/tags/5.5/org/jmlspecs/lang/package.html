<title>JML Language Types</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">

<p>
This package is a collection of types used in the definition of the
JML language.
</p>

<p>
At present the only type in this package is
<kbd><a href="JMLDataGroup.html">JMLDataGroup</a></kbd>.
The type <kbd><a href="JMLDataGroup.html">JMLDataGroup</a></kbd> is
useful for specifications that want to use Rustan Leino's notion of
data groups. 
This type has exactly one non-null value.
(That is, all non-null objects of the
type are <kbd>.equals</kbd> to each other.)
To declare the equivalent of a data group, declare a model value of
this type and make it depend on all of the elements of the data group.
Note that in JML, all public and protected fields also have an
implicit data group associated with them.
