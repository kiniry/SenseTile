# jmldoc -- script for running the JML documentation generator, jmldoc
#
# SYNOPSIS: set CLASSPATH and run jmldoc.

# If needed, change the following configuration parameters for your system
# by changing what is to the right of the equals sign (=) on the lines below
: ${JPATHSEP=';'}                           # change to ':' for Unix
: ${JFILESEP="\\"}                          # change to "/" for Unix
: ${JMLDIR=`cygpath -wa "/usr/local/JML"`}  # local home of JML
# The following is needed because jmldoc only works with the JDK 1.4 tools.jar;
# edit the path so that it points to tools.jar in your JDK 1.4 install.
: ${JDKTOOLS=`cygpath -wa "/usr/local/jdk1.4/lib/tools.jar"`}

CLASSPATH=".${JPATHSEP}${JMLDIR}${JFILESEP}bin${JFILESEP}jml-release.jar${JPATHSEP}${JMLDIR}${JFILESEP}specs${JPATHSEP}${JDKTOOLS}${JPATHSEP}${CLASSPATH}"
export CLASSPATH

# You can use `java' or `jre -classpath "$CLASSPATH"' below
# but these have to be in your PATH
exec java -Xms64m -Xmx128m org.jmlspecs.jmldoc.Main "$@"
