## At the bottom of this file we import $(TOPDIR)/Make.ProjDefs.  See the

## Note: in this directory, the .txt and the .html files are
## generated, but are still under CVS control.  This is because
## generation requires specialized tools that not everyone has or can
## run successfully.  So first check in the .1 files, then do a
## "make", then commit the products, if you can do that.  If you can't
## generate the products, talk to someone who can (like Gary).
