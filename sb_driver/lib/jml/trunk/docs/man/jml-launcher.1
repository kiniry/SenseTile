.SH NAME
jml-launcher \- Java Modeling Language (JML) tool launcher
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "jml-launcher"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The command
.B jml-launcher
starts a graphical user interface that can launch other JML tools.
These include the JML checker (jml), the runtime assertion checking
compiler (jmlc), the documentation generator (jmldoc), the
specification skeleton generator (jmlspec), and the unit testing file
generation tool (jmlunit).
.PP
The launcher can also be run by opening (double clicking) the file
bin/jml-release.jar that is part of the JML release.  The jar file and
the script both run the Java
class org.jmlspecs.launcher.JmlLauncher.
.PP
The user needs to be careful to set the
.B CLASSPATH
in the text box provided by the various tools.
When the launcher starts it may not have a proper
.B CLASSPATH
set.
.SH "WHAT TO READ"

If you are new to JML, you'll want to look
at some of the documents that ship with the system.
