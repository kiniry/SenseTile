                  embedding of the Object Constraint Language (OCL). OCL is
                  currently under development within an open standardization
                  process within the OMG; our work is an attempt to accompany
                  this process by a proposal solving open questions in a
                  consistent way and exploring alternatives of the language
                  design. Moreover, our encoding gives the foundation for
                  tool supported reasoning over OCL specifications, for
                  example as basis for test case generation.},
