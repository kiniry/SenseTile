<title>Specification Samples</title>

<p>
This package contains packages with samples of JML specifications.
Its intent is mostly educational.  The types contained in the packages
beneath this one are not used directly in JML's implementation.
However, they are used during testing of the implementation, and some
of them are used in the various documents.  Contributions are welcome.
</p>

<p>
All of the files in the subpackages check and pass the JML checker.
They should all be able to be compiled with jmlc also, except that the
dirobserver directory has specifications that are not (currently)
executable.  Aside from dirobserver, all the other subpackages have
JML/JUnit tests that pass, and can also be seen as examples of that
form of testing.
