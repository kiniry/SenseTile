<title>Specifications for the JML Reference Manual</title>

<p>
This package contains samples of JML specifications from the
<cite>JML Reference Manual</cite>.
The idea is that all (correct) examples from the reference
manual should appear here, so that they can be looked at
independently and checked by the checker and our tests.
