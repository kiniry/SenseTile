This package contains samples of JML specifications
relating to some abstractions of input and output.  These samples were
originally written by Arnd Poetzsch-Heffter, based on 
an example by K. Rustan M. Leino and Greg Nelson,
that appears in their paper "Data abstraction and information hiding"
(<cite>ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems</cite>,
volume 24, number 5, pp. 491-553, September 2002).
