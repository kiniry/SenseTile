New with release 5.5 (January 9, 2008)

   major improvements:

     - Various changes enable the new assertion semantics.  This
       semantics requires that users write "protective" specifications,
       in that the runtime checker will no longer attempt to mask
       exceptions that occur during assertion evaluation, but will
       instead propagate those out to the calling program. 
       Thus an assertion holds if and only if the assertion expression
       evaluates successfully (no exceptions are raised) and it is true.
       This new semantics has been turned on by default (to recover to
       old semantics use jmlc command line option -O). This fixes bug
       #1745623.  Thanks to Patrice Chalin and Frederic Rioux. 

     - Added the "refining" statement discussed in the jmlspecs-interest
       mailing list and a new keyword "extract" from the paper by
       Shaner, Leavens and Naumann (to appear in OOPSLA 2007).  This
       updated the checker and documents.  Thanks to Steve Shaner.

   minor improvements:

     - Fix to Bug #1746834, so that with the new RAC semantics
       the \min, \max, and \num_of quantifiers are now executable when
       they have a recognizable range.  Thanks to Frederic Rioux. 

     - Updates to enable Universe runtime checks in JMLRAC.
       Now the JMLRAC compiles the intermediate program with enabled
       Universe runtime checks. Thanks to Werner Dietl.

     - Added specification for the Universe runtime checks that allows
       one to use the Universe runtime checks together with the
       non-null type system.  Thanks to Werner Dietl.

     - Added specifications for several classes in java.awt, and
       java.awt.color.  Thanks to Patrice Chalin. 

     - Various small corrections to JDK specification, in particular
       with respect to nullity annotations.  Thanks to Patrice Chalin.

     - Put universe type system annotations in JML's specification for
       System.arraycopy, which allows copying to rep arrays from peer
       arrays.  Thanks to Werner Dietl.

     - Three corrections to the JML Reference Manual's grammar, thanks to
       Patrice Chalin and David Cok.

     - Noted that instance can be applied to invariants and other
       class-level annotations in the annotations appendix of the JML
       Reference Manual.  Thanks to Kristina Boysen. 

     - Some clarifications to the paper "JML: a Notation for Detailed
       Design", thanks to Faraz Hussain.

     - Fix to the specification of
       org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlkluwer.PriorityQueue.  Thanks to
       Patrice Chalin.

     - Fix to JML's NaturalNumber class, solving bug 1745382. 
       NaturalNumbers were being compared to BigIntegers, hence a
       compareTo(BigInteger) was added.  Without it compareTo(Object)
       was used, which gave a class cast exception.

     - Fixes to bug #1745635 for org/jmlspecs/samples in the
       list examples, PriorityQueue, and Digraph, Accounts, etc.
       Thanks to Patrice Chalin.

     - The documents and release procedures have been updated to
       reflect Gary's new location at UCF in Orlando, Florida.

     - The short-curcuit nature of the ==> and <== operators was
       clarified in the Reference Manual.  Plus various typo
       corrections.  Thanks to David Cok.

     - Various additions and corrections to the Reference Manual,
       including work on the chapters about refinement and redundancy.
       Thanks to Leo Freitas and Bertrand Meyer for questions that
       prompted these updates.

   incompatible changes:

     - The new assertion semantics is incompatible with the old
       underspecified total functions approach, to some extent.
       To recover to old semantics use the command line option -O on jmlc.
