\chapter{Introduction}

The aim of this thesis project was to model the SenseTile Sensor Board using Sensor Model Language (SensorML)\cite{SensoMLref} . A prototype of a Web Service for accessing SenseTile Sensor Board sensor observations was to be developed using this SensorML description of the SenseTile Sensor Board. An evaluation of the suitability of SensorML for use as part of the SenseTile System was also to be performed.

SenseTile is a sensor and processing package including motion sensors, RFID sensors, temperature sensor, audio sensors, pressure sensors, light level sensors video sensors among others. It is used as a replacement for standard ceiling tiles to provide smart building services as part of a Web Sensor Network. The SenseTile System is made up of two units a Sensor Board and Processor Unit. The sensors are interfaced or hosted on the Sensor Board. The Processor Unit interfaces to the Sensor Board allowing data from the Sensor Board to be processed futher as required.

SensorML is one of a number of specifications provided by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) as part of the Sensor Web Enablement(SWE) initiative[ref]. The members of the OGC have the goal of developing open standards to exploit Web connected sensors of all types. SensorML is used to describe sensor systems and the processing of sensor observations. It provides standard models and XML encodings to describe the process of sensor measurement. SensorML is described further in chapter x.

The SenseTile Web Service prototype allows access to the Sensor Board sensor observations and it's SensorML description. It runs on the SenseTile Processor Unit.  The Web Service is based on another OGC SWE  specification, the Sensor Observation Service (SOS)[ref]. This specification defines a standard Web interface for retrieving information about sensor systems and sensor observations. Sensor Board measurements that have been post processed and converted to real values or the raw Sensor Board data can be accessed using the Web Service. SOS Lite.

There are othe  SOS specification depend on another SWE specification, Observation and Measurements(O\&M)[ref]. This specification provides standard models and XML encoding for sensor observations.

A  SensorML to BON Mapping was also to be explored . BON\cite{BONref} is a notation and a method for Object Oriented systems analysis and design. Based on this mapping it was proposed to develop a tool/method to automatically generate SensorML descriptions. Generally SensorML is hand generated with all the shortcomings of such an approach. The proposed approach would allow sensor processing to defined formally in BON and then refined to JML/Java. 


\chapter{ Background Research}


\section{Sensor Web Enablement}
The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) [ref]  is establishing interfaces and protocols that will enable a standardised Sensor Web. It is hoped that an easier integration and development of sensor applications across sensor networks will be facilitated by this standarising activity.The OGC SWE provides a framework of open standards for use with Web-connected sensors and sensor systems. There are seven main specifications currently:

\begin{itemize}
\item  SensorModel Language(SensorML) - models and schema for sensor systems and processes surrounding measurements
\item  Observations \& Measurements (O\&M) - models and schema for packaging observation values
\item  Transducer Markup Language (TML) - models and schema for multiplexed data from sensor systems
\item  Sensor Observation Service (SOS) - standard web interface for accessing observations
\item  Sensor Planning Service (SPS) - standard web interface for tasking sensor systems and model and requesting acquisitions
\item   Sensor Alert Service (SAS) - standard web interface for publishing and subscribing to sensor alerts
\item   Web Notification Service (WNS) - standard web interface for asynchronous notification
\end{itemize}
There is also the SWE Common that provides common data models and schemas for the above.

Rather than define any new sensor models or XML formats for SenseTile it preferable to use the existing solutions if good enough for the task at hand. The SWE framework seems to cover all needs for modeling sensors and observations. Support the use of Web Services is the main rational and fits the needs of a SenseTile Sensor Network. In this case the SOS and SensorML are core.

Scalable - can be  large systems. Discovery. Process data without having to define an implementation as this
can be provided as part of SensorML description.

 DAML?

\section{Sensor Modeling Language}
Sensor Modelling Language (SensorML) is used to describe sensor systems and the processing of observations from sensor systems.

The purposes of SensorML are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide sensor and process information in support of resource and observation discovery
\item Support the processing and analysis of the sensor observations
\item Support the geolocation of observed values (measured data)
\item Provide performance characteristics (e.g., accuracy, threshold, etc.)
\item Provide an explicit description of the process by which an observation was obtained (i.e., itâ€™s lineage)
\item Provide an executable process chain for deriving new data products on demand (i.e., derivable observation)
\item Archive fundamental properties and assumptions regarding sensor systems
\end{itemize}

SensorML provides a functional model of sensors and an XML encoding to describe sensors and their observations.
Sensors are modelled as processes that convert real phenomena to data. Processes take inputs, process them and result in one or several outputs.

Sensor metadata is also supported by SensorML.  

The processes can be connected together in chains using SensorML ProcessChains or Systems. 

including measurement by a sensor system, as well as post-measurement
processing.

When Modeling a sensor system in SensorML the main entities used are Systems and Components. 

A SensorML System is used to group sensors that are related spatially to one another.  As it is a process chain it is hierarchical and so Systems can contain Systems.

A Component is an atomic process that generally converts a physical phenomena to a digital number. 

ProcessModels are another modeling that is used to describe a pure process that has no physicality. They point to an implementation or a description of one.

The data types used for inputs and out puts come another OGC sepc the SWE common. Examles are Quantity which is a decimal number, Count, Boolean, Category, and Time provide the basic primitives. Within SensorML, 

Aggregation of primitive data types are also provided DataRecord or DataArray.

A sensor systems would likely to be based mainly on Systems and
Detector model. Reference tutorial and sensorml specification.

The SensorML description of the SenseTile Sensor Board is described in chapter .

\section{Sensor Observation Service}
The SenseTile Web Service is based on the concepts described in the Sensor Observation Service (SOS) specification. The SOS defines a web service interface for the discovery of sensors systems and the retrieval of observations from sensor systems.  Observations are encoded as OGC O\&M Observations. Sensor systems metadata can be also be retrieved using the SOS interface and is generally defined in SensorML or TML.
para. An SOS organizes collections of related sensor system observations into Observation
Offerings. These operations are encoded in XML and used in http post and get operations. The XML message needs to be parsed to identify the operations, parameters and results. There seems to be work ongoing to change this to a more industry standard view of Web Services with the use of WSDL/SOAP. I could not find this as part of current OGC SWE framework.
para: Scalability would be achieved through aggregating a number of
sensor data producers on the sensor side and by aggregating a number of SOS instances
on the data center side for providing data to consumers. 
\subsection{SOS Data Consumer Operations}
There are there core operations that are provided by an SOS and used by SOS Clients to request sensor information:
 \begin{itemize}
\item GetObservation operation is used to obtain sensor observations and measurement data.
\item GetCapabilities operation is used to retrieve SOS service metadata.
\item DescribeSensor operation retrieves detailed information about the sensors .
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SOS Data Provider Operations}
Two other operations RegisterSensor and InsertObservation are of interest to this thesis . These are part of the SOS transactional interface. They are used with SOS data producers which are software entities connected to the sensor and have enough processing power to generate XML descriptions of the sensor data.

\subsection{SOS Catalogs}
The catalog aspect of SOS that used for discovery of the SOS instance is not covered in the Web Service Prototype described in this thesis. 
\subsection{Enhanced Operations}
Also six enhanced operations, GetResult,
GetFeatureOfInterest, GetFeatureOfInterestTime, DescribeFeatureOfInterest,
DescribeObservationType, and DescribeResultModel are not included in the SenseTileWeb Service.

\section{OGC Lib}
The VAST Team at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH)  developed an open source JAVA framework call swe-common-data-framework (http://code.google.com/p/swe-common-data-framework/) to allow the quick development of SWE services such as an SOS. In this project the library is used for it's SensorML parsing and SensorML process execution functionality.

\section{SensorML Model of SenseTile}

A SensorML model of SenseTile was developed as part of this thesis. The model contains metadata about the SenseTile system and supports the needs of the SenseTile Web Service. Two main requirements of the SenseTile Web Service were to be supported by the SensorML model. Firstly the raw data from the senors was to be retievable to allow external system process the data as desired. Secondly there was a requirement to do post processing on the Processor Unit of the sensor data to convert it to meaningful values. A block diagram of the Sensetile SensorML model is shown in figure \ref{fig:SenseTileSystem}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\framebox{\scalebox{0.70}{\includegraphics{SenseTileSystem.png}}}
\caption{SenseTile System Block Diagram}\label{fig:SenseTileSystem}
\end{figure}

Three SensorML Systems are used to model the SenseTile as shown in the block diagram. One SensorML System models the overall SenseTile which contains the Sensor Board and Conversion Systems. The below XML fragment shows how SensorML describes System containment using a component list and how the other SensorML Systems descriptions are referenced using xlink hrefs.

\lstset{language=XML,basicstyle=\scriptsize,frame=single}
\begin{lstlisting}
<sml:components>
        <sml:ComponentList>
               <sml:component name="sensorBoardSystem" 
                                          xlink:href="SensorBoardSystem.xml">
               </sml:component>
               <sml:component name="convertorSystem"  
                                          xlink:href="ConverterSystem.xml">
               </sml:component>
        </sml:ComponentList>			   
 </sml:components>
\end{lstlisting}

The physical phenomena measured by the sensors are the input to the  SenseTile System. These values will be read in from packets received from the Sensor Board. The Digital Number output is the raw sensor data which is a digital number without a physical meaning. The Converted Measurement output contains the values from post processing the sensor data which have some physical meaning such as temperature in Celcius.

The division of the systems is based on the concept that sensor observations are based on at least a sampling process and a conversion process{ref tutorial}. The Sensor Board System contains SensorML Components that model the sensors on the board that perform the sampling. The SensorML Components contained in the Conversion System model processes that produce meaningful physical measurement values such as temperature and lumens from the sampled data.

The SenseTile System connects up the inputs and outputs of the SensorBoard and Convertor Systems using SensorML connections. The below SensorML fragment shows how the temperature output from the SensorBoard System is connected to the input of the Conversion System is peformed in SensorML.
\newpage
\begin{lstlisting}
<sml:connection name="convertToTemperature">
    <sml:Link>
        <sml:source ref="sensorBoardSystem/outputs/temperatureDNOutput"/>
        <sml:destination ref="convertorSystem/inputs/celciusConvInput"/>
     </sml:Link>
 </sml:connection>
\end{lstlisting}



A more detailed block diagram of the Sensetile SensorML model with Components is shown in figure \ref{fig:SensorML_SenseTile_System_comp}. Only the Thermistor Component and the Celcius Component are developed as part of this thesis. They are described in model detail in later sections.
\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{SenseTile System Components}\label{fig:SensorML_SenseTile_System_comp}
\end{figure}




Naming rules for inputs and outputs - allow more generic handling of implementation classes.

System and components are in several files. Inline in one file if desired.Choice to seperate files.

\subsection{Thermistor Component}
The Thermistor on the SenseTile Sensor board is the Texas Instruments TMP175 Digital Temperature Sensor and is modeled with a SensorML Component. This is an indivisible process and can have a different location information than the Sensor Board if required. The SensorML Component allows the capabilities of the Thermsistor to be described. For example the TMP175 is  specified for operation over a temperature range of âˆ’40Â°C to +125Â°C. This is captured in the following SensorML:

\begin{lstlisting}
<swe:field name="TemperatureRange" 
           xlink:arcrole="urn:ogc:def:property:dynamicRange">
          <swe:QuantityRange definition="urn:ogc:def:property:temperature">
                   <swe:uom code="cel" /> 
                          <swe:value>-40 125/swe:value> 
           </swe:QuantityRange>
</swe:field>
\end{lstlisting}

The SensorML Thermistor temperature input is modeled using a Quantity value without any units as is a measured physical phenomena. Its output is a digital number from the sensor. The range is constrained to the allowed value range from the Thermistor. The following fragment shows how the input and outputs for the Thermistor look in SensorML:

\begin{lstlisting}
<sml:inputs>
    <sml:InputList>
         <sml:input name="thermistorInput">
             <swe:Quantity definition="urn:ogc:def:phenomenon:temperature">
         </sml:input>
    </sml:InputList>
</sml:inputs>

<sml:outputs>
    <sml:OutputList>
          <sml:output name="thermistorOutput">
               <swe:Count>
	        <swe:constraint>
                         <swe:AllowedValue id="outputRange">
                              <swe:interval>-880 2032</swe:interval>
                         </swe:AllowedValue>
                     </swe:constraint>
                </swe:Count>
           </sml:output>
     </sml:OutputList>
 </sml:outputs>
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Celcius Converter Component}

The SensoML Celcius Converter SensorML Component  models a process that performs a conversion of the Thermistors digital number output to a real quantity celcius value. It similar to the Thermistor SensorML description but its inputs and outputs are different. It process method performs a simple calcution to perform the celcius conversion.

A Sensor process method was also developed. The process method describes the coversion algorithm and points to an implementation class. Process Methods are not implemented by the Vast Lib so it not used in the running system. Instead the method tag provides a URN that is used to lookup the implementation class.

\section{SenseTile Web Service}
\subsection{Overview}

The SenseTile Web Service is based on the Sensor Observation Service (SOS) as described previously. The two main entities in the SOS Specification, the Sensor Data Provider and the SOS,  are used to structure the SenseTile Web Service. These entities are implemented as seperate software components that together provide the service. The Sensor Data Provider component will be referred to as the DataProvider in this design.

The two components are run as seperate processes on the SenseTile processor unit to allow a more flexible network architecture.  This network architecture is described in more detail in section \ref{subsec:SenseTile WebService Network Architecture}. The basic system structure is shown in figure \ref {fig:Deployment_sensetile} .

\begin{figure}[h]
\scalebox{0.65}{\includegraphics{Deployment_sensetile.png}}
\caption{SenseTile Web Service}\label{fig:Deployment_sensetile}
\end{figure}

The DataProvider parses a SensorML description of the SenseTile System, reads sensor data form the Sensor Board and provides the sensor data as O\&M Observations to the SOS. The SenseTile SOS will implement the SOS core operations to allow a client to get these observations. The following sections describe the design of the DataProvider and SOS components as well as the scenarios they support.

\subsection{Supported Scenarios}

\end{tabular}
\caption{Scenario Chart for SenseTile Web Service}
\label{ex:table}
\end{table}
\subsection{SenseTile WebService Network Architecture}
\label{subsec:SenseTile WebService Network Architecture}
In the SenseTile Web Service the SOS acts as a gateway to the SenseTile Sensor Network. This prototype was designed with the network architecture as shown in fig \ref{fig:Deployment_network}. A client would access multiple SOS instances to get observations from the sensor network. An SOS could support several DataProducers and hence would not to be run on every SenseTile. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\scalebox{0.65}{\includegraphics{Deployment_sensetile_network.png}}
\caption{SenseTile Sensor Network Architecture}\label{fig:Deployment_network}
\end{figure}
The SOS Specification envisioned that the SOS would be run on a large external server as shown in fig \ref{fig:Deployment_ext_sos}. The DataProviders would update this external server with observations and clients would just access this large SOS.
\begin{figure}[h]
\scalebox{0.65}{\includegraphics{Deployment_sensetile_ext_sos.png}}
\caption{External SOS}\label{fig:Deployment_ext_sos}
\end{figure}
The SOS Specification describes the use of a Proxy SOS as shown in figure \ref{fig:Deployment_sos_aggr}. This architecture could be used with the SenseTile Sensor Network if accessing many SOSs is not feasible for the clients.
\begin{figure}[h]
\scalebox{0.65}{\includegraphics{Deployment_sensetile_sos_aggr.png}}
\caption{Proxy SOS}\label{fig:Deployment_sos_aggr}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{DataProducer}
The DataProducer's role, as described previously, is to read sensor data from the Sensor Board and generate O\&M observations. These observations are then sent to the SOS instance. The processing of the sensor data to generate the observations is described by the SensorML models. The DataProducer uses the OGC Vast Library to instantiate objects that implement the required data processing chains based on the SensorML models. The BON static diagram \ref{fig:bon_static_diagam_producer.png}
 shows the main clusters and classes of the DataProvider.

The SMLEngine cluster contains classes that provide access to
the Vast Lib that is providing the SensorML Engine.  The Vast Lib implemenation
of the SensorML Engine is hidden from the rest of the code thus.

The Sensors and Converters clusters contain classes that provide
implementation of process methods for SensorML components in the SensorBoard and
Converter SensorML Models respectively. These are referred to as sensor objects and
converter objects henceforth.

The DataProducer operates by repeating the below steps continously.
 \begin{enumerate}
\item Read Sensor Board Data
\item Process Sensor Data
\item Create O\&M Observations
\end{enumerate}
The steps above are detailed the in following sections with reference
to the BON static diagram \ref{fig:bon_static_diagam_producer.png}.

\subsubsection {1. Read Sensor Board Data}

The UCD SensorBoard Library is used by DataProducer to access
the data generated by the Sensor Board.
The library provides high level interface to the
the data from the sensor board. It reads data from the Sensor board and generates packets
containing the sensor data. These packets provide functionality
to access a particular sensors data such as the temperature
meaurement generated by the thermistor. 
This library is shown as the SensorBoard cluster in \ref{fig:bon_static_diagam_producer.png}
An instance of the class PacketInputStream to is used access the packets from the Sensor Board.

The DataProducer uses the Observer pattern to provide
packets to the SensorMLEngine for processing.
At start up the SenseTileSystem reads the list of sensor objects from the SMLEngine that
implement the Sensors interface. These objects provide an entry point
to the SensorML processing chain and can read data from the UCD LIB packets.
These sensor objects implement reading strategies for the type of data they read. 
For example the ThermistorSensor reads out the temperature value
but will average it before it sent to the SensorML Engine for processing.

\subsubsection {2. Process Sensor Data}
The PacketInputStream will request the SenseTileSystem to exexcute
the SensorML engine to process the sensor data. The SensoML Enigine
will execute the process chains described in the SenseTile SensorML model.
The sensor objects output will be passed to the coverter objects. The
outputs of both object types are then available to generate observations.

\subsubsection {3. Create O\&M Observations}

When the SensorML Engine is finished
and there are obsevations generated these
need to be sent to the SOS. An O\&M Onservation
xml string containing the data is sent to
the SOS instance. This is timestamped at
this stage.
 containing the output from
the SensorML processes and send the observations
to the SOS.
-register offerings with the SOS. In this design
each system is an offering.
Need to generate an observation model?


Questions.
If have light data but no temp. As temp is only
every 1000 packets?

How to know when to generate observation
for the two offerings?
DataProducer generates observations in Observation xml standard.

Interface to the SensorBoard Library.

Uses observer pattern to update sensors with packets from the board.

reads sensors from SensorBoard System xml

Sensors iimplement interface to facilitate this.

Vast lib connects all the processes

implementation of sensor and convertor is named using URN read from the sensorMl descption.


The DataProducer was developed as a SensorML based software. It would be parse the SenseTile SensorML model to instantiate the code to excute the processes described. This required two aspects to be developed, a framework to run the processes and classes that implemented the components.

Keeps track of sensorboards that register

provides an RMI interface to the DataProducer to update with observations. This has lower overhead
than a web service. Though it would not be hard to change to use a Web Service Interface.

GetObservaton - marshal Observation to xml string and send as response.

StreamObservation -  registered clients get new observation sent over UDP connection?
