explanation
  "The main function is to host or interface with a number \
  \of sensors, and to partially process captured data. \
  \This cluster contains a set of subclusters, each of which \
  \is an implementation of the sensetile board architecture."

cluster SENSOR
description
  "This cluster contains a set of classes designed for measuring \
  \and converting a physical quantity into a signal which can be \
  \read by an observer AMPLIFIER cluster."

  \the amplitude of a signal."

cluster GATE_ARRAY

  \all interface function between BUS, CODEC (what is \
  \a purpose of CODEC ?), STORAGE and CONVERTER \
  \clusters."

cluster MICRO
description
"This cluster have not yet specified."

cluster CONVERTER
description
  "This cluster contains  a set of subclusters, each of which is \
  \an implementation of the signal converter. The converter \
  \converts signals and their levels to discrete/analogue signals \
  \and vice versa."

  \the different voltage levels in order to supply components."

   \implementation of transfer data mechanism between clusters."
  
cluster STORAGE
description
  "This cluster represents an additional local storage \
  \which provides the highest speed, low power consumption \
  \and simple interfacing."
end

cluster CHANNEL
description
  "This cluster represents communication channel, \
   \and holds two subclusters, each of which is an \
   \implementaton of the medium used to convey \
   \packet stream from a sender-GATE_ARRAY cluster \
   \(or transmitter?) to a receiver."

explanation
  "This cluster provides two main user interfaces, \ 
  \a slave SPI(Serial Peripheral Interface) interface, \
  \used mainly for supervisory control \
  \and status monitoring of GATE_ARRAY operation, \
  \and an asynchronous interface to a BUS cluster."

cluster SPI
description
  "The SPI interface is a slave only interface. \
  \It is the only interface through which the user can \
  \directly access the CONTROL_REGISTER cluster. The SPI cluster \
  \is connected only to the CONTROL_REGISTER cluster."

cluster REGISTER
description
  "This cluster provides SPI addressable registers and integrates \
  \the two classes to aid in gate array operations."

  "This cluster represents asynchronous Data Streaming Interface. \
  \All data streamed from/to CONVERTOR cluster travels \
  \through the this interface."

explanation
"This cluster holds two classes: \
\The registar class and registar type class."

class REGISTER
description
"This class represents register component which stores bits of information, \
\in a way that all the bits can be written to or read out simultaneously."

class REGISTER_TYPE
description
"CONTROL: \
 \This type describes enabling signals \
 \for data sampling functionality. \
 \STATUS : \
 \This type describes mode information \
 \and some input packet error detection. \
 \PACKET_COUNTER : \
 \This type describes the following process: \
 \The counter is incremented every time \
 \a output packet is created, the value of \
 \the Packet Counter is also one of the \
 \characters in the output packet. The packet \
 \counter value is reset every time there is a \
 \register write to the control module via \
 \the SPI slave cluster. \
 \I/O: \
 \This type describes general purpose command(s) \
 \(read/write) data and transfer between the MICRO and \ 
 \GATE_ARRAY clusters."
